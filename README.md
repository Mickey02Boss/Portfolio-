# GHOSTED
i wish love would've been enough to save us because i had so much more to give, but you didn't know how to hold it and i didn't know when to quit.
if i'm being honest, ill never feel this way about anyone else because there's a part of me that won't ever know how to stop loving you. like muscle memory, i do it without even trying
i miss you in a desperate kind of way. i miss you like you're just gone for the weekend and i'll see you on sunday.
maybe in another lifetime i know when to let go
maybe in another lifetime i don't need to
